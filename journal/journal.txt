week 1
I use AI by helping me brainstorm ideas. 

week 2
 I used AI to help me understand more concepts in Python. There were concpets in the assingment that I needed a refresher on. 
 These are my ChatGPT conversation:    https://chatgpt.com/share/68d078e6-aa48-800f-a27d-b01f76e2cb73

For example, I needed to understand the concept of sorted in Python. 
In the beginning, I didn' know what the code for making something in alphabetical order so I had to ask ChatGPT: "What is the code for making something alphabetical."
 I think ChatGPT can be very helpful when it comes to Python as it can not only give a explination of the code but also show you example codes.
 I also used it to remind myself how to remove something from a list, how to use i in range, and how to slice a list.
