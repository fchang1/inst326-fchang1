week 1
I use AI by helping me brainstorm ideas. 

week 2
 I used AI to help me understand more concepts in Python. There were concpets in the assingment that I needed a refresher on. 
 These are my ChatGPT conversation:    https://chatgpt.com/share/68d078e6-aa48-800f-a27d-b01f76e2cb73

For example, I needed to understand the concept of sorted in Python. 
In the beginning, I didn' know what the code for making something in alphabetical order so I had to ask ChatGPT: "What is the code for making something alphabetical."
 I think ChatGPT can be very helpful when it comes to Python as it can not only give a explination of the code but also show you example codes.
 I also used it to remind myself how to remove something from a list, how to use i in range, and how to slice a list.

Week 3 
For this weeks assingment, I used online website that specialize in code and explinations. I was able to refer to that website when I needed help or clarification on a question. The website name is W3 schools. Here is my chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d9ee3b-a4ec-800f-b9d0-6d7f3e7e8b69
This week was more tedious and the questions seemed straight foward but I still needed an explination on them. I found myseld refering to ChatGPT for clarification and more indpeth explination on a topic. I used Chat to help me understand tuples and explain it futher as it was mentioned in the assingment.

Week 4 
This week assignments it was very interesting. I liked how there as prompts and then an example code to run that made it easy to test my code with. I was able to use that test code to ensure my code ran smoothly. For the coding itself it was pretty repetivie which allowed me to understand a little better and get into a flow for coding this weeks assignment. For this weeks assignment I did use ChatGPT and here is my conversation: https://chatgpt.com/share/68e32aba-f0b4-800f-b351-e50ead514d44
I used it to clarify some topics and explain more simply to me to understand for this weeks assignment.

Week 5 
This weeks assignment I found a little hard to understand at first. I asked ChatGPT to help explain a few concepts. One concpet I asked it to explain was ValueError. I have seen this before but I haven't really used it that much with assignments. I learned that this is used when you are giving the fuctions the right type of data but the wrong type of value. After asking ChatGPT a few more concepts I was able to understand the assignment more. This is my conversation with ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/share/68ec1f50-f534-800f-ab75-5bb3c63bc53c

Week 6
This week I completed the assigment. I used ChatGPT to help me understand a little more what the main instructions of the assignment asked from me. I used this to help explain some definitions such as classmethods. This was used greatly in this weeks exercise which I why I wanted to get a better understanding of it. I found out that classmethods are used inside a class that belongs to the class itself. This allows it to access and manipulate data. I also asked it to go more in depth about class attributes and how it relates to the assignment. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68fe19b5-7a84-800f-bc30-e1f585840953 

Week 7
This week I completed the assignment with clarification from ChatGPT. Chat has helped me understand concepts from the assignments. It has also helped me understand what specific concepts I am being asked in the assignments. It can be helpful to provide examples on specific function concepts to gain a better understanding of it.
